## BYI..
<p align="center">
I have very crude humor which invoves sexual/violent remarks towards my friends and saying slurs I can reclaim. If you're not comfortable with this, tell me.

I have a general distaste for MOST of the [CH] ships I see, but I won't outright assail them until it's Rusame or Sovreich.

<sub>"But but- Fjord! Let people ship what they want! It isn't harming you!</sub> Jump. I have the full freedom to hate whatever ship I want. Yes that includes the ones that people like to tell me about. Just because I didn't say anything when you were talking about your little OTP doesn't mean I think it isn't utterly stupid.

I sometimes do end up talking about sensitive topics like abuse or SH, but most of the time it's always in regards to my OCs. Of course, this doesn't mean i condone any of it. If you find that uncomfortable, I won't talk about it.

My name is Fjord. You can call me whichever you see fit, though, none of it is really of my concern. I have interest in many things, but the fandoms that I'm most active in are CH and G&B, where I tend to make the most art about. Fair hint? If you show me your OC and yap about them a little, there's a high probability I'll draw them. 
<p align="center">
I find interest in conservation and US history (large surprise we've got here), so I don't think it's too surprising as to why I have all this on this page. I like to listen to industrial metal and talk to my friends too.
